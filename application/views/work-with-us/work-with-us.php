                This internship helped me develop a holistic view as I had to make FAQs with answers from all the important topics taught during my four years course. FAQs module is very credible as the questions are picked up from reliable sources from the net. During the module development, the entire team of skillpromise was there to guide me and progress review meetings were also held from time to time, and also we had to give a daily progress report. Skillpromise pays well and on time. I got a LinkedIn recommendation, which was the main driving force for me to complete this task with excellence, accuracy and incisiveness.”

It was empowering, promising but most importantly, it made me realize why I chose to major in Economics along with my ongoing Bachelor’s degree in Commerce. None of this would’ve been possible without our mentor, Vikas sir, who cheered us like a friend and brought out the best in us, like family. He worked relentlessly with our team as we curated subjective modules, backed by extensive research, to enhance and prepare aspirants for entrance exams and interviews, for all subjects. It’s rare that we find such an inspiration amongst us, who not only encourages our work but makes sure we know that we’re capable of greater heights. Our LinkedIn recommendation was the cherry on top of the cake made of the best virtual internship experience so far. Although, it seems unfit to quantify this wonderful opportunity in denominations, the remuneration was at par with our work nights and motivated us to believe in the phrase ‘Hard work pays off’, literally. My sincerest wishes to the team for doing a commendable job..”

I was new to this work but with constant help, daily work review and performance appreciation, I was encouraged to do my work with much more dedication. From editing more than 150 topics and converting over 200 links into Harvard style of referencing to working on a project with NIPPON paints and automotives called QUEST 2.0, its like a dream come true. Because of my hard work, I was given 100% increment in my stipend. At start, I didn’t thought that I am capable of so much responsibilities, but with the guidance of the Skillpromise team now I know that I am capable of much more.

None of this would’ve been possible without our mentor, Vikas sir, who cheered us like a friend and brought out the best in us, like family. He worked relentlessly with our team as we curated subjective modules, backed by extensive research, to enhance and prepare aspirants for entrance exams and interviews, for all subjects. It’s rare that we find such an inspiration amongst us, who not only encourages our work but makes sure we know that we’re capable of greater heights. Our LinkedIn recommendation was the cherry on top of the cake made of the best virtual internship experience so far. Although, it seems unfit to quantify this wonderful opportunity in denominations, the remuneration was at par with our work nights and motivated us to believe in the phrase ‘Hard work pays off’, literally.

                  “My name is Sanjana Sunidhi and I am in my second year, pursuing my Bachelors in Philosophy from Lakshmibai College, University of Delhi. I worked as an content intern at Skillpromise. This project had helped me a lot in polishing my content writing skills. My mentor guided me during the entire tenure of my internship, making me understand every single detail I need to keep in my mind while content creation. He also provided me with an opportunity to mentor other interns regarding their work. Moreover, he continuously helped me to improve by conducting regular reviews and by giving constructive inputs regarding my work. Along with timely payments and regular recognitions, Skillpromise team gifted me with so many life-lessons which I would never forget. I am glad to be a part of his team and the skills which I’ve gained here are surely going to help me in future.”
