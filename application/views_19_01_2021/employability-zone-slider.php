                    <h5 class="sub-title">Employability Scenario in India</h5>
                    <p>Employability is a huge challenge our education system is facing today. According to NSS,
                        only 20% of Engineers, 22% of MBA’s and only 10-15% of college graduates are employable.<br><br>
                        Only 2.5% of Indian engineers possess the skills in artificial intelligence (i.e., machine
                        learning and data science) that industry requires. Only 1.5% - 4.5% of engineers possess the
                        necessary skills in data engineering, while only 2.8% - 5.3% are qualified in wireless
                        technologies. These figures pale compared to the percentage of engineers (5.5%) that are
                        qualified for basic programming. However, the true employability figures for data science
                        are actually much lower: only 50% - 60% of these numbers (or 1.5% total) when we factor in
                        other skills such as cognitive and language that are key for career success. Good coding skills
                        (the ability to write functionally correct code) are possessed by 4.6% of Indian job
                        applicants, 2.1% of Chinese candidates and 18.8% of the US candidates in the IT and
                        software industries<br><br>
