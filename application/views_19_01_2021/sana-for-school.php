                    <p>Self-Assessment is the is the process of gathering information about yourself in order to make informed and intelligent Life decisions.</p>
                    <p>Self-Assessment helps you find the right direction for your life. Right direction in life is very important to channelize your efforts and resources. It is very important for School students to ask themselves the following questions:</p>
                    <ul class="custom">
                        <li>Do I know my needs?</li>
                        <li>Do I know what motivates me?</li>
                        <li>Do I have a Direction in life? Do I have  well defined Goals for my life?</li>
                        <li>Do I have the required resources to pursue my Goals?</li>
                        <li>Are my Goals in line with my Values, Skills, Strengths, Attitude, Intelligence mix, and Areas of Improvement?</li>
                        <li>Do I Operate with any Limiting beliefs about Learning, Relationships and about my Capabilities? </li>
                        <li>Do I take Ownership?</li>
                        <li>Do I know what excites me the most and keeps me sleepless?</li>
                        <li>Are my efforts Informed and Channelized? How am I performing in my Endeavours?</li>
                        <li>Do I need to Reengineer myself? What do I need to do, to Reengineer myself?</li>
                        <li>Am ion my Life Path or is it  getting driven by my Family and Friends?</li>
                        <li>Do I respect People and Protocols?</li>
                        <li>Do I know what my Parents, Friends and Teachers think about me?</li>

                    </ul><br>
                    <p>All the above mentioned questions ultimately bring out the need of a Blue print for life. A blue print for life can also be defined as a Life plan. Self-Assessment forms the base for Life Planning. Life Planning is dynamic activity, in which, you requires constant Aiming and Shooting. This makes Self-Assessment a periodic activity. Self-Assessment frequency completely depends on the agility levels that you define, to be current on knowledge on self. School time is the best time to make your first life plan.</p>
