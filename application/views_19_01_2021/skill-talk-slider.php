It makes them work as if their lives depend on it. Sense of urgency becomes very important in today’s scenario because of increasing rate of change. A sense of urgency is the determination to stay focused on results and deadlines until the task is completed. Sense of Urgency drives “Follow through”. Bill Gates, in his book The Road Ahead, said that he always felt that Microsoft is on the losing side and this attitude created the required sense of urgency and helped the company strive to be the number one player in the highly competitive software market. A sense of urgency is responsible for a student suddenly getting a “Productivity boost” a couple of days before the exam</p>

                    <p>
                        While setting goals it is important that you set a challenging goal. Only a challenging goal will create an environment of proactivity, energy and sense of urgency.

                       This is a self-imposed way of making yourself accountable. When you declare your goals, others expect you to meet them in the promised time. This indirectly builds the required pressure in your mind to meet their expectations and you act with a sense of urgency.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="sub-sub-title">Let Fear of Loss motivate you more than the desire to gain</h5>
                    <p>
                       This attitude is important to avoid the comfort zone. If you feel that you are winning, then there are chances that you might slow down or become casual.

                       Sense of Urgency for finishing a task is very high when you are fully aware of the loss arising because of non completion of the task. Dell, a multinational Computer technology company, has a standard practice of creating a sense of urgency in customer’s mind about purchase of warranties by asking them about the cost of down time.

                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <h5 class="sub-sub-title">Task Prioritization</h5>
                    <p>
                       Prioritize important activities by dividing them into Must, Should and Could categories daily. This brings sense of urgency around important activities.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="sub-title">A Closing thought</h5>
                    <p>We should fight the temptation of surrendering to our comfort zones. This, if not done, will push us into complacency which will have a negative impact on productivity. A strong sense of urgency will provide the energy, the inspiration to work hard, and proactivity to complete tasks ahead of deadlines. It is important that we put words like As soon as possible, Now, Immediately, today etc. to practice. Doing things with a sense of urgency will make us action oriented, launch things quickly and transform us into a WINNER!</p>
